  ## Description:
  - I built this project to provide an easy way for managers to track their employees, roles, salaries, and departments in one database and with one app.
  - This project solves the issue of needing to track information about a company's departments, roles, salaries, and employees.
  - I learned how to handle many different types of requests and queries in SQL during the development of this project.
  - This project stands out for its being self-contained rather than requiring syncing to a remote database.
